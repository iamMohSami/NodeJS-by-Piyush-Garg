Consider a scenario : 
Person A and B : A wants to send a mail/letter to B
The envelope contains a letter inside it : on envelope , it is written , Addiitonal Data

From :A 
To : B 
weight : 200gms


NOW, ANALOGY TO SERVER-CLIENT INTERACTION : 
A = client : B = server : Envelope = Request : Inside letter = Actual Data
and Additional Data on envelope = HTTP HEADER 

From : 192.165.12.1 (senders IP)
To : 10.21.124.13 (recievers IP)
Content Type : JSON 

i.e. HTTP HEADERS => METADATA of the request made

Headers are used in both Request and Responses

IN POSTMAN APP ; we can view both request and response headers 

IN RESPONSE HEADERS : 
we have one header => X-Powered-By = Express
This is a Custom Header used by Express to show that this server is running on Express(self-promotion) 

Can we also create a CUSTOM HEADER??  HELL YEAH.!!
industry practice for adding custom header - "USE X-....." 
For example -> X-MyName : MOhammad Sami

app.get("/api/users" , (req,res) => {
    res.setHeader("X-MyName" , "Mohammad Sami") ; 
    return res.json(users) ; 
});
