we saw that , our version of EXPRESS is : 
 "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.19.1",
 }

 here, what does ^ mean , 4 mean , 19 mean , and 1 mean ? 

 1st part -> 4 
 2nd part -> 19
 3rd part -> 1 

 HERE,

 3rd part (last part) -> MINOR FIXES | Optional Update | Chota Mota bug fixes 

 2nd part -> RECOMMENDED SECURITY/BUG FIX or UPDATES/ADDING NEW FEATURES | critical bug fix or Big New Updates 

 1st part -> MAJOR RELEASE / BREAKING UPDATE
 you should never update major release on your existing code applications as it contains major changes which maybe break ur applications
 Only if you are starting with a new project from start then only you should update it

 NOTE => 
 while installing express : npm i express  {will always install latest update}

 to install specific version : npm i express@4.11.2 

 ^ carat symbol : will always update evry new version BUT NEVER MAJOR RELEASE
 if we do : npm uninstall express
 it will automatically update to newset version but will alsways lock the first digit (major release number)

if we have : 

~4.18.2 squiggly symbol : will always update only last digit , 1st and 2nd number updates are locked until user does update it manunally
