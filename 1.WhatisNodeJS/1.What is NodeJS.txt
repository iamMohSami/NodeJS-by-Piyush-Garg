JS = To make webpages interactive

Where Does JS can be executed ? 
In Console of Browser..! 
i.e. we need to always create html files in order to run JS 

Every Browser has a "ENGINE" preinstalled in it which runs this JS
Chrome = V8 Engine (The Best and most popular)
FireFox = SpiderMonkey
Safari = Apple Engine

Scientist Ryan Dahl , 
Chrome's V8 Engine embedded with C++ --> NODEJS

Benefits ? 
Can run JS outside of Browser
Can do File Handling and create webservers

Thus, NodeJS is not a Programming Lang or Framework but a "RUN TIME ENVIRONMENT FOR JS"

can use NodeJS in Command Prompt too 

install nodeJS (Odd-Even Approach for Versioning)
EVEN = 18.12.1 LTS(Long Term Support)  => ADVISABLE 
ODD = 19.3.0 Beta / Testing version 

In command prompt : 
node --version

type = node OPENS NODEJS INTERACTIVE TERMINAL IN COMMAND PROMPT WHERE YOU CAN RUN JS

npm -v 
(Node Package Manager)
